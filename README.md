ðŸŒ± EqualChain â€“ ESG + DEI Supplier Intelligence Platform
Team EqualChain | Walmart Sparkathon 2025

EqualChain is an AI-powered dashboard that empowers Walmart and other retail giants to make data-driven, ethical, and sustainable supplier decisions.
Our platform evaluates suppliers based on Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) metrics combined with Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) indicators â€” helping organizations align with their sustainability and inclusion goals.

ðŸ§  Problem Statement
Walmart is under increasing pressure to:

Improve supplier sustainability
Ensure ethical sourcing
Enhance diversity and inclusion
Streamline large-scale supplier evaluations
However, no centralized tool currently exists to score, filter, and visualize thousands of suppliers based on COâ‚‚ emissions, packaging, certifications, and ownership diversity.

âœ… Our Solution
EqualChain automatically:

âœ… Merges and cleans multiple supplier datasets
âœ… Scores suppliers using ESG + DEI metrics
âœ… Provides powerful filtering options and visual dashboards
âœ… Enables real-time decision-making and supplier rankings
âœ… Supports exportable reports and maps (if geolocation is available)
